Create a Python Programm that will do the following. 
FIRST: Prompt the user to give you 3 Numbers 
NEXT: The programm will check the bigest number and tell the user from the
three values collected from the user 

Create a Python Programm that will do the following. 
First: Ask the user to enter a number and the programm should report
if the number is an even number or an odd Number 

Create a Python Programm that will do the following. 
First: The program will ask the user for two numbers and when divided it should
return the remainder,
Create a Python Programm that will do the following. 
First: Prompt the user to enter three numbers and return the numbers or print 
the numbers base on their acending order 

We need to Python Programm that will ask the user to enter five names 
of student in their class 
when you are enterinh last student we want you the programm to print
all the 5 student in that class 
NEX: The programm should be able to check if the names if up to 5 or less
If the student names is less than 5 it should keep asking the user to continue
entering the student names

Create a python Program that will have a list of 10 numbers and then print all the even numbers in the list 

Create a python Program that will have a list of 10 numbers and then print all the odd numbers in the list 

# gamingAge = int(input("Enter your Age"))

# Mutable
# Duplicate
# fetch data base on index postion
# Range

# range(10)

# for eachCount in range(10):
#     print(eachCount)

# formFiveStudent1 = ["Paul","Mary","Suzan"]
# for eachStudent in formFiveStudent1:
#     if eachStudent == "admin":
#         print(eachStudent)
#         continue


def userInput(desc):
    return input(desc)


initValue =1
while initValue < 4:
   userInput(f"Enter {initValue} Student Name? ") 
   initValue  += 1
print("Done")

Create a Python program that will prompt the user to perform the following actions:

User Registration
User Login
NB: We need three files: register.py, login.py, and main.py.
The main.py file will be used to call all the other functions.

The program should allow the user to register, and the data will be stored in a list.
Upon completing registration, the system should prompt the user to log in using the details they provided during account creation.

The user will have three attempts to log in.

If the first and second attempts fail, the system should warn the user.
On the third attempt, if they fail again, the system should block the user and display a message stating that their account is blocked.
The user will then be instructed to contact an administrator for assistance.
Managing the login logic, including how the blocked status is handled, is up to you.

Welcome Screen
Upon launching the program, the following options should be displayed:

WELCOME TO UBANK  
Press C to Open an Account  
Press L to Login  
Press CL to Terminate the Session  
When the user terminates the session, the system should display:

Thank you for visiting us. See you next time.
NB: We need to utilize all the Python concepts we have covered so far.

PYTHON ASSIGNMENT
Program Style: OOP
Program: Calculator

Write a Python program that allows the user to perform calculator functionalities.

Welcome to P Calculator
Steps:
When the user runs the program, they should be prompted to enter:
First Number
Select an Operator (+, -, /, *, %)
Second Number
The program should perform the calculation based on the selected operator and display the correct output.
Note:
Each operation (+, -, *, /, %) should be implemented in a separate method.
Good Luck! ðŸš€
